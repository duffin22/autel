Hector is designed to simplify agricultural surveying using drones produced by Autel Robotics.  Given a polygon drawn by the user, the application will produce and store a survey route that will cover the entire selected area.  With the click of a button, Hector will convert this route into coordinates, transmit them to an active drone, and have it carry out the flight plan.
